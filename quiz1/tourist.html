The entire construction was completed on September 10, 1909 (25 Shaban 1329 Hijri) as well as being used which was marked by the implementation of the first Friday prayer at this mosque. The entire construction cost one million Guilders. The Sultan deliberately built this royal mosque magnificently, because in principle it was more important than the splendor of his own palace, Istana Maimun. The funding for the construction of this mosque was borne by the Sultan himself, but it is said that Tjong A Fie, a Medan city figure from Chinese ethnicity who was contemporaries of Sultan Ma'moen Al Rasyid contributed to funding the construction of this mosque.</p>
